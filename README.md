# SpaceGame
A quick game build solely off of the visual effect of the particles in the center, i thought it looked like flying through a galaxy, 
so i made a game around it. Is also my entry for January of One Game a Month, and is about flying through space peacefully destroying 
enemies that mean you no harm.
